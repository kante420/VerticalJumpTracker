# VerticalJumpTracker

The project consists on a vertical jump tracker, based on the time of flight method. The idea is to measure the height of jump, based on the time of flight.

Thanks to this values, we can calculate the take-off speed (vertical speed your center of mass has the instant your feet leave the ground), the peak power (maximum rate of force application during the jump — basically, how much mechanical energy you’re producing per second) and the relative peak power (peak power normalized to body mass — how much power you produce per kilogram of body weight).

The components that are going to be used for the project are:
- Arduino Uno
- VL53L0X
- LCD 16x2 with I2C interface
- TM1637 display of 7-segments and 4 digits
- Push button
